**Interface**

```python
def custom_Reduction(
    shape, 
    dtype, 
    axis, 
    op, 
    coeff,
    kernel_name="cce_reductionLayer",
    need_build=False, 
    need_print=False):
```

**Description**

Reduce the input tensor on a certain axis, and scale output with coeff.

Suppose we have an n-axis bottom Blob with shape:

(d0, d1, d2, ..., d(m-1), dm, d(m+1), ..., d(n-1))

If axis == m, the output Blob will have shape

(d0, d1, d2, ..., d(m-1))

And the ReductionOp operation is performed (d0 * d1 * d2 * ... * d(m-1)) times, each including (dm * d(m+1) * ... * d(n-1)) individual data.

If axis == 0 (the default), the output Blob always has the empty shape (count 1), performing reduction across the entire input. Often useful for creating new loss functions.

**Args:**

- shape : input tensor's shape
- dtype : input tensor's dtype, support:`float16,float32`
- axis : the first axis to reduce
- op : can only be one of "SUM, ASUM (sum of abs), SUMSQ (sum of sqr), MEAN"
- coeff : scale for output
- kernel_name: op's kernel func name, optional
- need_build: whether build CCEC kernel, default is `False`, optional
- need_print: whether print IR, default is `False`, optional

**Returns:**

No returns, generate op's .o file and .json file(describe op's platform) in `./kernel_meta`

**Notice**

1. Before plugin compilation, please change the ddk path of the file makefile
2. Please change the ddk version in "omg.sh" if necessary.
3. In order to get the NPU model(.om), please run "source env_omg.sh"  in the omg_verify folder, and then "make clean;make" in the plugin folder,  and "bash omg.sh" in the omg_verify folder.
