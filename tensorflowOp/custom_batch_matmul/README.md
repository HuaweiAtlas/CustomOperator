**Interface**

```python
def custom_batch_matmul(
    shape_x, 
    shape_y, 
    dtype, 
    trans_a=False, 
    trans_b=False, 
    kernel_name = "cce_tf_batch_matmul", 
    need_build = False,
    need_print = False):
```

**Description**

Multiplies slices of two tensors in batches(each slice can be viewed as an element of a batch), the output is of the same batch size.

Each of the individual slices can optionally be transposed before multiplication by setting the trans_a or trans_b flag to True, which are by default False. The input tensors are 2-D or higher with the shape [..., r_x, c_x] and [..., r_y, c_y]. The output tensor is 2-D or higher with the shape [..., r_o, c_o], where
r_o = c_x if trans_a else r_x
c_o = r_y if trans_b else c_y

**Args:**

- shape_x : shape of the first tensor x with rank > 1
- shape_y : shape of the second tensor y with the same type and shape with x
- dtype: input tensor's dtype, support:`float16,float32`
- trans_a : if True, shape_x is transposed before multiplication
- trans_b : if True, shape_y is transposed before multiplication
- kernel_name: op's kernel function name
- need_build: whether build CCEC kernel
- need_print: whether print IR

**Returns:**

No returns, generate op's .o file and .json file(describe op's platform) in `./kernel_meta`

**Notice**

1. Before plugin compilation, please change the ddk path of the file makefile
2. Please change the ddk version in "omg.sh" if necessary.
3. In order to get the NPU model(.om), please run "source env_omg.sh"  in the omg_verify folder, and then "make clean;make" in the plugin folder,  and "bash omg.sh" in the omg_verify folder.
